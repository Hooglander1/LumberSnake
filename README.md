# LumberSnake
Tableau VizQL Analysis in Python

HOW TO USE LUMBERSNAKE TM (v1.2)
=========================================

Step 1.
Place into a folder of your choice.

Step 2.
In that same folder, create a folder called "Log Dump". 
If you don't, you'll see a warning and Python will quit.
Place your vizqlserver files in there.
### Logs.zip > vizqlserver > Logs > vizqlserver*.txt

Step 3.
Run LumberSnake (1.2).exe


NOTE:
- LumberSnake will delete the VizQL files after processing (for space).
- If you've run this before, make sure LumberSnake.csv is closed.
- When importing in to Tableau - you may have to edit the text file properties:
	> Text File Properties > Text Qualifier > "

Release notes:
- Versioning is now a thing
- Fixed UTF-8 errors
- Also creates a file detailing the time taken to process.
