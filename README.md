HOW TO USE LUMBERSNAKE TM (v2018.2)
=========================================

Step 1.
Place into a folder of your choice. Ideally next to your extracted Server logs.

Step 2.
Run the LumberSnake v2018.2.exe / .py and select your extracted log files. 

Step 3.
Connect the output file to the workbook in the repository.


NOTE:
- If you've run this before, make sure LumberSnake.csv is closed.
- When importing in to Tableau - you may have to edit the text file properties:
	> Text File Properties > Text Qualifier > "

Release notes:
- Requires the Tableau Server to be on 2018.2 or up (Windows) or any Linux version.
- No longer greedily deletes files.
- Extracts directly for you (note: this process can take some time).

=========================================

Release notes:
